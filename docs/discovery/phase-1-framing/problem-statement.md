# Problem Statement

## The Problem

Solo tabletop RPG players must simultaneously act as player, game master, oracle, and record-keeper. This cognitive juggling creates friction that pulls them out of the immersive player experience they're seeking.

Specific pain points include:
- **Creative generation fatigue**: Generating story hooks, worldbuilding details, NPC personalities, and plot twists while also trying to be surprised by the narrative
- **Rules arbitration overhead**: Looking up and applying rules from the game system mid-session
- **Record-keeping burden**: Tracking NPCs, locations, history, character state, and inventory across sessions
- **Session continuity**: Remembering context and maintaining narrative coherence when resuming after days or weeks

## Who Experiences This Problem

**Primary user**: Solo RPG players who:
- Cannot find or prefer not to play with a group
- Want to test new rule systems before introducing them to a group
- Have limited time (30-60 minute sessions) and need easy pickup/resume
- Play across multiple RPG systems (D&D, Fate, Traveller, Ironsworn, etc.)
- Use oracle systems (Mythic GME, Solo Toolkit, Adventure Crafter) to drive emergent narrative

## Current Solutions and Their Limitations

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Paper + dice + random tables | Manual, no persistence, easy to lose context |
| Obsidian/markdown notes | Good for records, but no rules/oracle integration |
| Mythic GME Android App | Oracle only, no rules system, limited record-keeping |
| Generic AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude) | No game state persistence, no structured randomness, inconsistent rules application |
| Virtual tabletops (Roll20, Foundry) | Designed for groups, heavy setup, overkill for solo |

## Desired Outcome

A solo RPG player can focus entirely on playing their character while an AI-powered system handles:
- Game mastering (scene framing, NPC responses, consequence narration)
- Oracle functions (structured randomness for plot twists, events, surprises)
- Rules reference and application
- Persistent game state (characters, NPCs, locations, history, inventory)

The player experiences the narrative flow of a GM-led game, with the surprise and emergence of oracle-driven play, without the cognitive overhead of managing it all themselves.

## Success Criteria

- Player can start a session and be "in the game" within 2 minutes
- Player can resume a campaign after weeks and have full context restored
- Player experiences genuine surprise from AI-generated events (driven by structured tools like Adventure Crafter)
- Rules are applied consistently without manual lookup
- All game state is automatically tracked and queryable
