# Competitor Analysis: Solo RPG Tools & AI-Powered RPG Assistants

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Project**: Solo RPG App
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Research & Exploration

---

## Executive Summary

The solo RPG market is a growing niche within the broader TTRPG market (valued at USD 2.15 billion in 2025, expected to reach USD 6.59 billion by 2035 with 11.84% CAGR). Solo RPG players represent a dedicated subsegment with 19% of players above 50 exploring journaling-style or minimal-DM games. The r/Solo_Roleplaying subreddit serves as a central community hub.

The competitive landscape consists of three main categories:
1. **Traditional solo RPG digital tools** - Apps for Mythic GME, oracles, and solo engines
2. **AI-powered RPG assistants** - AI dungeon masters and story generators
3. **Adjacent tools** - Virtual tabletops with solo support and journaling RPG apps

Key findings:
- Most traditional solo tools focus on oracle functions but lack AI-powered creative generation
- AI tools provide story generation but lack structured RPG mechanics and persistent state
- No existing solution combines modular rules systems, AI generation, and comprehensive record-keeping
- Pricing models range from free/PWYW to $10-50/month subscriptions or one-time purchases

## 5. Key Competitive Gaps & Opportunities

### Gaps in Current Solutions

**1. No Modular Rules System Integration**
- Existing tools are either system-agnostic (generic oracles) or locked to one system (Ironsworn, D&D 5e)
- No solution offers swappable rules systems (e.g., Fate Accelerated, Powered by the Apocalypse, OSR)
- Players must use separate tools for different games

**2. AI + Structure Gap**
- AI tools provide creative generation but lack structured game mechanics
- Traditional solo tools have mechanics but rely on manual interpretation of random tables
- No tool combines AI creative generation with automated rules support

**3. Persistent State Management**
- Most tools lack comprehensive campaign/character persistence
- Limited session continuity features
- No cross-session narrative tracking
- Poor long-term record-keeping

**4. Oracle + Rules Separation**
- Oracle functions (Mythic GME, yes/no questions) exist separately from rules systems
- No integrated approach where oracles inform rules-based outcomes
- Manual translation between oracle results and game mechanics

**5. Local-First with Cloud AI**
- Most AI tools require cloud subscriptions and store data remotely
- Privacy/control concerns for some users
- No BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model found
